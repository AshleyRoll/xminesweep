xminesweep is a game in which you have to mark all the mines in a playing 
field, you have to work out where they are from information about the 
number of mines around a Cell in the playing field. It is an addictive mind 
game ;)

For information on how to use this porgram consult the man page 
(xminesweep.man).

MAKING THE PROGRAM.

First you must decide if you want to allow the cheat mode (Find and expose a 
square with no mines around it - useful for starting a game) and 
if you *DO NOT* want to use it then you must edit the Imakefile or the 
Makefile.normal depending on which one you will be using. You must remove the 
line that has -DCHEAT_OK on it.

If you are going to use the cheat mode then you can change the translation 
that triggers the cheatmode. it is in the file xminesweep.c. (look for a 
translation that calls Cheat_Toggle() ). At the moment the key sequence is:

Ctrl-Shit-C (but you must press C twice like a double click (or hold it down)).

If your system is based on system V, then you will have to edit the 
Imakefile or the Makefile.normal (which ever you are going to use) and
add the -DSYSTEM_V define to the list of definations.

if you can use Imake, then:

xmkmf
make install
make install.man

otherwise:

mv Makefile.normal Makefile
make

you will then have to move the executable and the man page to the appropriate
directories manually.
____________________________________________________________________________

Once you have installed the program and the manual page you can delete all the
other files (the execuatable is fully selfcontained and doesn't require any
data files).

MACHINES:

This program has been successfully compiled on several SUN series 4 machines 
running X11R5.

____________________________________________________________________________
Known BUGS:

There have been problems with the program on a SUN 3/60, where no matter where
the mouse is clicked to reveal a square, the bottom right square is exposed.
I have a feeling that this is something to do with the X libs.

Have Fun.
